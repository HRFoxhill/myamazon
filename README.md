amazon like app

My app currently takes the user through a few simple prompts to allow them to create a User with unique id that is then assigned to their shopping cart as they add Items. 

The Items/products that they add are then added to their cart and subtracted from the product inventory to reflect the amount of products available, outside of their currently populated shopping cart, each time they add a new item. 

the user will be prompted after each Item selected, how many of they items they would like to purchase. If they select a number larger than the available inventory they will be alerted that there arent enough of that item and directed back to select that item or a new one, and to choose a quantity. 

After selecting and Item and quantity the User is asked if they would like to checkout, if they say no they are directed back to select more items, if they say yes the system compiles a Cart Total and displays the amount that they will owe now thay they have finished shopping.
